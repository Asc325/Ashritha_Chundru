Hi, I'm Ashritha 👋

Machine Learning Engineer | 3D Vision | Reinforcement Learning | Robotics | Embodied AI

I work at the intersection of machine learning, 3D reconstruction, and human–environment interaction.
My experience spans:

2D → 3D reconstruction pipelines

Depth, pose, and fusion models (MiDaS, Detectron2, Open3D)

Neural rendering & geometry-aware ML (PyTorch3D, Blender API)

Physics-informed ML for dynamics/human motion

Adaptive policies & online model recalibration

Zero-to-one ML product building (ANVYA)

I'm currently pursuing my MSc in Human & Biological Robotics at Imperial College London, and building full ML systems from scratch — from modelling to evaluation to deployment.
